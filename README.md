# WARNING:
Single player worlds will break repeatedly as the pack is still under heavy development!
- If you still want to play it then expect your stuff to be reset/borked a lot
- No, I'm not helping you if something breaks, I'm probably working on a problem
- You can get the pack as a full and always up to date release [here](https://github.com/RedAngel121/NytePack/releases/download/NytePack/NytePack_Installer.zip)
- Requires Prism Launcher or AT Launcher to play, ***CurseForge and Microsoft are not compatable.***
- Once a public server is ready we will be making an announcement in the Discord

# ~ BUILD TEAM NOTES ~
## Pack Build Rules are as follows:
1. No Easy Teleporting items or players (CoRail's Death Key Exception and Stargates)
2. No Easy Backpacks or On-Person Inventory Storage (Toolbelt and Agricraft Pouch Exceptions or similar item specific inv spaces)
3. Pack Theme is more Dieselpunk/Factory with long-term goals and community play, Endgame TBD (InterPlanetary Travel? what about Stargates?)
4. Crafting Recipes Inter-Connectivity is desired between most mods for increased complexity pack longevity
5. Power storage, production, and transfer, will be handled in world and not by items on the player (to the best of ability)
6. Player travel will be with large scale projects such as Planes/Trains/Stargates/Rockets and not on person items I.E. jetpacks (apoth excluded)

## More Immediate Settings and Changes
1. We need to dive into Vein Mining Enchant configs (and by extension Farming options) to determine how Vein Mining is actually going to affect the player hunger and tool durability.
2. Right now we want EXTREMELY large veins sparsely placed in the world, no other ore gen exists other than Create's world gen stuff
3. "Ore Factories" will have different ways of processing ore per type:
  - More complex ore processing will yield better results
    - Initial layout will be one raw chunk of ore in a furnace makes a nugget
    - One raw ore chunk in create mixer makes multiple nuggets
  - Mekanism (not included) is a good example of this
4. We need to hash out Currency and Proper Chunk Claiming and how to pay for it through/with Lightmans Currency.
  - How does this factor into Starting Cash? Mob Cash Drops? Chest Loot? Taxes? and other options?
  - What options do we have for purchasing chunk loading times? cant find anything on this yet... find a chunk loader that accepts "fuel"?

## Update to 1.20.1 in June 2024
### New Additions
- Add [Quark DynTrees Compat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-trees-quark) when it's available

# Things to look at much later:
### QOL:
- [FancyMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fancymenu): Lots of work
- [PackMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/packmenu): Lots of work

- [Create Interactive](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-interactive): probably not happening due to possible performance/compat issues, will test later
- [Alex's Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-mobs): some of the mobs are just horrible and need to be disabled/tuned
- [Supplementaries](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/supplementaries): lots of problems with this that im not super intersted in fine tuning yet
- [Comforts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/comforts): possible compat issues with Serene Seasons?
- [Nightmare Epic Siege](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nightmareesm): Disable 90% of the mod: Most things are not ok but more intelligent mobs could be interesting
- [Natures Aura](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natures-aura): possible server overhead issues because of the chunk aura updates

- [Deeper and Darker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deeperdarker):
  - Not something I want personally, but how far outside the realm of the pack is it really?
- [The Undergarden](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-undergarden):
  - Not something I want personally, but how far outside the realm of the pack is it really?

# Hard No:
- Enhanced Celestials (harvest moon is the only befenit and doesnt provide enough to warrant including the mod)
- Lootr (will not be added as it floods the market with items/loot)
- Mekanism (is most likely not included because its too streamlined and technically advanced and would need heavy edits to function the way we want)

# Additional Mod/Config Changes:
- Investigate Create: Steam and Rails for stuff we dont want like phantom rails/bogies
- Investigate Sophisticated Storage settings or disable some upgrades
- Agricraft: Test if mutated crops hold stats after gowing without crop sticks and replanting and replanting and replanting
- Adjust the corail tombstone config as needed
- Toolbelt Blacklist Options
- Lightmans Currency
  - Figure out how taxes are going to work
  - Claim Purchasing options
- Immersive Aircraft
  - Better integration with alternative tech and crafting recipes
- Philip's Ruins
  - Increase Distance Between Ruins
- Create Mod Possible Issues:
  - Mechanical Drill makes things too easy, slow down or disable ore drilling? (only if Geolosys replacement can be added)
- Adjust Scaling Health Mod:
  - Remove the crafting items or change the recipies
  - Use https://github.com/SilentChaos512/ScalingHealth/wiki/Making-a-datapack
- Gateways to Eternity
  - Add an absolute metric ton of gateways *cause thats going to be fun*
  - Could have integration with lightmans for special purchases (Tickets for Heart Canisters?)
- Baubley Heart Canisters
  - Heart cans need to be added to purchasable items from server vending machines (red = 2 / yellow = 4 / green = 8 / blue = 16)

# Lastly,
- Change Client keybind config and upload to the Nytepack_Installer.Zip
- Remove World Stripper and other Admin only mods
- Sort out Server vs Client side mods
- Edit the Server Startup Script to allow packwiz management
- Turn off Wandering Trader `/gamerule doTraderSpawning false` (or find it in server configs)
- Change Sleep % to 0

### Server Update Command Line:
- `java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://redangel121.github.io/NytePack/pack.toml -g -s server`
- For use on servers, add the `-g` flag to disable the GUI and `-s server` to download only server-side mods.
- Then start the minecraft dedicated server using the premade server script
