# NytePack
**Welcome to NytePack where innovation is productivity!**
- [Join The GameNytes Discord!](https://discord.gg/kkjwfuz)

# WARNING:
### Single player worlds will break repeatedly as the pack is still under heavy development!
- If you still want to play it then expect your stuff to be reset/borked a lot
- No, I'm not helping you if something breaks, I'm probably working that problem anyway
- You can get the pack as a full and always up to date release [here](https://github.com/RedAngel121/NytePack/releases/download/NytePack/NytePack_Installer.zip)
- Requires Prism Launcher or AT Launcher to play, ***CurseForge and Microsoft are not compatable.***
- Once a public server is ready I will be making an announcement in the Discord

### Multiplayer Server Rules and things to know:
- Spawn is a Safe Haven; Protected and Defended. Do not find a way to destroy it lest your life be forefit.
- Food and XP grow your health, both are reset on death. Find a way to make better foods and earn more XP to stay alive.
- PVP is enabled but not encouraged, unsecured items can be stolen if you left out... so maybe dont do that.
- After a Players death, the items will be locked in the corpse for 7 days, after which corpses become lootable.
- You can Claim Land by purchasing the amount you want, Claims will be deleted after 90 days of inactivity.
- Enemies grow stronger with distance from spawn, do not stray far without preparing yourself for that.
- Different dimensions empower enemies greatly, steel yourself for the fights of your life.
- more info to come when i need to share it

# ~ BUILD TEAM NOTES ~
## Pack Build Rules are as follows:
1. No Easy Teleporting items or players (Stargates Exception because power limitations)
2. No Easy Backpacks or On-Person Inventory Storage (Toolbelt and Agricraft Pouch Exceptions or similar item specific inv spaces)
3. Pack Theme is more Dieselpunk/Factory with long-term goals and community play, Endgame TBD (InterPlanetary/Travel/Stargates/?)
4. Crafting Recipes Inter-Connectivity is desired between most mods for increased complexity pack longevity
5. Power storage, production, and transfer, will be handled in world and not by items on the player (to the best of ability)
6. Player travel will be with large scale projects such as Planes/Trains/Stargates/Rockets and not on person items like jetpacks (apoth excluded)

# More Immediate Settings and Changes
- [x] Upgraded Terrain Generation and Ore Generation
- [x] Adapted Ore Generation from all different mods
- [x] Vein Mining Enchant configs to determine its effects on hunger and durability
- [ ] Turn off Vanilla Village generation
- [ ] I need to hash out Proper Chunk Claiming (FLAN) and how to pay for it with Lightmans Currency
- [ ] Adjust Mob Cash Drops: deep dive into lightmans to find and lower natural drop count to 1-5 coins per mob
- [ ] Mechano? (Unreleased Mod Still Under Heavy Development / Might need to consider New Age in the meantime)
- [ ] Change the required items in the More Minecarts mod chunk loader to accept coins instead of "crystal" stuff ([not yet possible](https://github.com/ryyanmapes/minecart-mod/issues/97))
- [ ] Gateways to Eternity
  - Add an absolute metric ton of gateways with all types of mobs (add alex mobs?) *cause thats going to be fun*
  - Find out what rewards should be allowed

# Big Changers
- [ ] Add loot tabes from other mods for lightmans to insert coins into
- [ ] Create Mod Possible Mining Issues - Mechanical Drill makes things too easy, slow down or disable ore drilling?
- [ ] Immersive Aircraft Recipe Integration with alternative tech mods
- [ ] Modify SGJ recipes to make building a stargate more difficult and resource intensive
- [ ] "Ore Factories" will have different ways of processing ore per type:
  - Initial layout will be one raw chunk of ore in a furnace makes a nugget
  - 1 raw chunk in create mixer with water makes 1-3 nuggets
  - 1 raw chunk in a grind mill makes 1-2 crushed ore, smelted for 2 nuggets each or washed for 3-5 nuggets
  - the entire Ore Block can double or triple this input/output
  - More complex ore processing will yield better results
  - Mekanism is a good example of this

# Things to look into:
### QOL:
- [FancyMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fancymenu) OR [PackMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/packmenu): Both are lots of work...

### Heavy Consideration:
- waiting for [NoMo' Portals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-mo-portals) to update and include the Undergarden portal
- Sparky's Loot Box: 1/1000 chance of a stick named "Fred's Other Cousin" / 1/10000 chance of spawning a blaze rod named "Fred's Cousin" / 1/100000 chance of spawning a pufferfish named "Fred"
- [Lit it Up](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lit-it-up): making furnaces a bit more realistic
- [Mekanism](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mekanism)
  - Heavily modified ore gen and recipes to counter its easy access, should not be accessable before visiting alternate dims for ore (lock behind Naq?)
- [The Undergarden](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-undergarden) is a large scale upgrade to include with scaling health mod

### Interesting Ideas:
- [Alex's Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-mobs): some of the mobs are just horrible and need to be disabled
- [Aquaculture](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aquaculture): remove neptunium stuff or adjust it
- [Beyond Earth](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/beyond-earth):
  - Progression beyond steel/netherite and I make other planets actually useful
  - Awating 7.0 update and maybe even avoiding depeding on whats included (July 2024?)
- [Comforts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/comforts)
- [Create: Dreams and Desires](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-dreams-desires): Possibly incompatable with pack direction due to tools
- [Deeper and Darker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deeperdarker) small mod but could be fun (disable wireless chest access?)
- [Natures Aura](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natures-aura): possible server overhead issues because of the chunk aura updates
- [Nightmare Epic Siege](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nightmareesm): Disable 90% of the mod: Most things are not ok but more intelligent mobs could be interesting
- [PneumaticCraft: Repressurized](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pneumaticcraft-repressurized) And [Compressed Creativity](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compressedcreativity)
- [Supplementaries](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/supplementaries): lots of problems with this that im not super intersted in fine tuning yet

# Additional Server World Changes:
- Find out how much Starting Cash will be needed to play on the server
- Disable Portals to other Dims and use a Stargate instead (Add a mod to do this)
  - Stargate will need to be **Pay to Enter** based on destination and have easy access to return from each dimension
  - **Nether** payment will be Iron coins and a diamond
  - **End** payment will be Gold coins and netherite ingot
  - **Abydos** payment will be Emerald coins and block of azure silver?
  - **Undergarden** payment will be Diamond coins and a stargate base block
- Starting town either built by hand or built with a mod (minecolonies fortress maybe?)
  - Will need seperate buildings for different styles of gameplay
  - Server Owned Vending machines as money sinks: Starter Gear, Armors, Weapons, Basic Food, Simple Items, ETC
- Baubley Heart Canisters need to be added to purchasable items from server vending machines
  - Amulet can be purchased (find good price) maybe Earned with Easy Gateways?
  - bones can be earned with gateways and natural mob spawns
  - red can = 9 wither bones
  - yellow can = 9 red cans and an iron coin
  - green can = 9 yellow cans and a gold coin
  - blue can = 9 green cans and an emerald coin

# Lastly,
- Change Client keybind config and upload to the Nytepack_Installer.Zip
- Remove World Stripper and other Admin only mods
- Sort out Server vs Client side only mods
- Edit the Server Startup Script to allow packwiz management
- Turn off Wandering Trader `/gamerule doTraderSpawning false` (or find it in server configs)
- Change Sleep % to 1 (add sleeping bags or something if you want more than 10%)

### Server Update Command Line:
- `java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://redangel121.github.io/NytePack/pack.toml -g -s server`
- For use on servers, add the `-g` flag to disable the GUI and `-s server` to download only server-side mods
- Then start the minecraft dedicated server using the premade server script
