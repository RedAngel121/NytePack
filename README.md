**Welcome to NytePack where innovation is productivity!**

# WARNING:
Single player worlds will break repeatedly as the pack is still under heavy development!
- If you still want to play it then expect your stuff to be reset/borked a lot
- No, I'm not helping you if something breaks, I'm probably working on a problem
- You can get the pack as a full and always up to date release [here](https://github.com/RedAngel121/NytePack/releases/download/NytePack/NytePack_Installer.zip)
- Requires Prism Launcher or AT Launcher to play, ***CurseForge and Microsoft are not compatable.***
- Once a public server is ready I will be making an announcement in the Discord

# ~ BUILD TEAM NOTES ~
## Pack Build Rules are as follows:
1. No Easy Teleporting items or players (Stargates Exception)
2. No Easy Backpacks or On-Person Inventory Storage (Toolbelt and Agricraft Pouch Exceptions or similar item specific inv spaces)
3. Pack Theme is more Dieselpunk/Factory with long-term goals and community play, Endgame TBD (InterPlanetary/Travel/Stargates/?)
4. Crafting Recipes Inter-Connectivity is desired between most mods for increased complexity pack longevity
5. Power storage, production, and transfer, will be handled in world and not by items on the player (to the best of ability)
6. Player travel will be with large scale projects such as Planes/Trains/Stargates/Rockets and not on person items I.E. jetpacks (apoth excluded)

## More Immediate Settings and Changes
1. I need to dive into Vein Mining Enchant configs (and by extension Farming options) to determine how Vein Mining is actually going to affect the player hunger and tool durability.
2. Right now I have large veins sparsely placed in the world, no other ore gen exists other than Create's world gen stuff
3. "Ore Factories" will have different ways of processing ore per type:
  - Initial layout will be one raw chunk of ore in a furnace makes a nugget
  - One raw ore chunk in create mixer makes 1-3 nuggets
  - 1 raw ore in a crushing wheel makes 1-2 crushed ore, then into washer makes 2-4 nuggets each
  - More complex ore processing will yield better results
    - Mekanism (not included) is a good example of this
4. I need to hash out Currency and Proper Chunk Claiming and how to pay for it through/with Lightmans Currency.
  - How does this factor into:
    - Starting Cash? 5i
    - Mob Cash Drops? deep dive
    - Chest Loot? mostly fixed
    - Taxes? nah...
  - What options do I have for purchasing chunk loading times? cant find anything on this yet... find a chunk loader that accepts "fuel"?

### New Additions and Changes
- Add [Quark DynTrees Compat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-trees-quark) when it's available
- Mechano? (Unreleased Mod Still Under Heavy Development / Might need to consider New Age in the meantime)
- Modify Ore Gen:
  - less gold/redstone
  - Terralith (deep dive)
  - Incendium (deep dive)
  - Emeralds (missing editable files / do they really need to be changed? / check recipes for crafting requirements)

  - Progression beyond steel/netherite and I make other planets actually useful
  - Awating 7.0 update and maybe even avoiding depeding on whats included (July 2024?)
- [Create Interactive](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-interactive): probably not happening due to possible performance/compat issues, will test later
- [Alex's Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-mobs): some of the mobs are just horrible and need to be disabled/tuned

- [Comforts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/comforts): possible compat issues with Serene Seasons?

- [The Undergarden](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-undergarden)

# Hard No:
- Enhanced Celestials (harvest moon is the only befenit and doesnt provide enough to warrant including the mod)
- Lootr (will not be added as it floods the market with items/loot)
- Mekanism (is most likely not included because its too streamlined and technically advanced and would need heavy edits to function the way I want)

# Additional Mod/Config Changes:
- Investigate Create: Steam and Rails for stuff I dont want like phantom rails/bogies
- Agricraft: Test if mutated crops hold stats after gowing without crop sticks and replanting and replanting and replanting
- Toolbelt Blacklist Options
- Lightmans Currency Claim Purchasing options and force loads
- Immersive Aircraft Recipe Integration with alternative tech mods
- Philip's Ruins Needs Increased Distance Between Ruins
- Create Mod Possible Issues - Mechanical Drill makes things too easy, slow down or disable ore drilling?
- Baubley Heart Canisters need to be added to purchasable items from server vending machines using unique tokens (red = 2 / yellow = 4 / green = 8 / blue = 16)
- Gateways to Eternity
  - Add an absolute metric ton of gateways *cause thats going to be fun*
  - Could have integration with lightmans for special purchases (Tickets for Heart Canisters?)

# Lastly,
- Change Client keybind config and upload to the Nytepack_Installer.Zip
- Remove World Stripper and other Admin only mods
- Sort out Server vs Client side only mods
- Edit the Server Startup Script to allow packwiz management
- Turn off Wandering Trader `/gamerule doTraderSpawning false` (or find it in server configs)
- Change Sleep % to 0

### Server Update Command Line:
- `java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://redangel121.github.io/NytePack/pack.toml -g -s server`
- For use on servers, add the `-g` flag to disable the GUI and `-s server` to download only server-side mods.
- Then start the minecraft dedicated server using the premade server script
