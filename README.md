We need to talk about Ore Gen... and how that works THEN how it factors in Vein Mining + Farming.
Ore factories will have different ways of processing ore per type
We need to talk about Currency and Proper Chunk Claiming and how to pay for it. How does this factor into Starting Cash/Mob drops/Loot Chests/UBI + Taxes and other options.

Balance is Key!
