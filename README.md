# WARNING:
Single player worlds will break repeatedly as the pack is still under heavy development!
- If you still want to play it then expect your stuff to be reset/borked a lot
- No, I'm not helping you if something breaks, I'm probably working on a problem
- You can get the pack as a full and always up to date release [here](https://github.com/RedAngel121/NytePack/releases/download/NytePack/NytePack_Installer.zip)
- Requires Prism Launcher or AT Launcher to play, ***CurseForge and Microsoft are not compatable.***
- Once a public server is ready we will be making an announcement in the Discord

# ~ BUILD TEAM NOTES ~
## Pack Build Rules are as follows:
1. No Easy Teleporting items or players (CoRail's Death Key Exception and Stargates)
2. No Easy Backpacks or On-Person Inventory Storage (Toolbelt and Agricraft Pouch Exceptions or similar item specific inv spaces)
3. Pack Theme is more Dieselpunk/Factory with long-term goals and community play, Endgame TBD (InterPlanetary Travel? what about Stargates?)
4. Crafting Recipes Inter-Connectivity is desired between most mods for increased complexity and semi-realism
5. Power storage, production, and transfer, will be handled in world and not by items on the player (to the best of ability)
6. Player travel will be with large scale projects such as Planes/Trains/Stargates/Rockets and not jetpacks or similar (apoth excluded)

## More Immediate Settings and Changes
1. We need to dive into Vein Mining Enchant configs (and by extension Farming options) to determine how Vein Mining is actually going to affect the player hunger and tool durability.
2. Right now we have EXTREMELY large veins sparsely placed in the world, no other ore gen exists other than Create's world gen stuff
3. "Ore Factories" will have different ways of processing ore per type:
  - More complex ore processing will yield better results
    - Initial layout will be one raw chunk of ore in a furnace makes a nugget
    - One raw ore chunk in create mixer makes multiple nuggets
  - Mekanism (not included) is a good example of this
4. We need to talk about Currency and Proper Chunk Claiming and how to pay for it through/with Lightmans Currency.
  - How does this factor into Starting Cash? Mob Cash Drops? Chest Loot? Taxes? and other options?
  - What options do we have for purchasing chunk loading times? cant find anything on this yet... find a chunk loader that accepts "fuel"?

## Update to 1.20.1 in June 2024
- ReAdd Agricraft ASAP

### New Additions
- Mechano? (Unreleased Mod Still Under Heavy Development)

  - Progression beyond steel/netherite and we make other planets actually useful
  - Awating 7.0 update and maybe even avoiding depeding on whats included (July 2024?)
- [Create: Dreams and Desires](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-dreams-desires): check for Ore Gen and see whats not compatable
- [Create: Connected](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-connected): should be fine but still look at it first

### World:
- None at this time

# Things to look at much later:
### QOL:
- [FancyMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fancymenu): Lots of work
- [PackMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/packmenu): Lots of work

### Mods:
- [Create Interactive](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-interactive): probably not happening due to possible performance/compat issues, will test later
- [Alex's Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-mobs): some of the mobs are just horrible and need to be disabled
- [Supplementaries](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/supplementaries): lots of problems with this that im not super intersted in fine tuning yet
- [Comforts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/comforts): possible compat issues with Serene Seasons?
- [Nightmare Epic Siege](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nightmareesm): Disable 90% of the mod: Most things are not ok but more intelligent mobs could be interesting

- [Lit it Up](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lit-it-up): making furnaces more realistic
- [Burning Furnace](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/burning-furnace): making furnaces more dangerous

### World:

- [Deeper and Darker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deeperdarker): not available for 1.18
- [The Undergarden](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-undergarden)
  - Not something i want personally, but how far outside the realm of the pack is it really?
  - Maybe we could turn it into a planet instead of a portal for use with Beyond Earth?

# Hard No:
- Enhanced Celestials (harvest moon is the only befenit and doesnt provide enough to warrant including the mod)
- Lootr (will not be added as it floods the market with items)
- Mekanism (is most likely not included because its too streamlined and technically advanced and would need heavy edits to function the way we want)

# Additional Mod/Config Changes:
- Quark
  - Blacklist Soph Chests from Sorting buttons as they have built in sorting
  - Disable Quark's Backpack and other inventory expansion options
  - [DynTrees compat required when it's available](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-trees-quark)
- Connected Textures do not work with Framed Blocks... replace with Copycats Plus?
  - CT does not work with Framed Blocks in 1.18.2: frame blocks register CT but not with each other or orig block

  - Increase distance slightly between caches (structures world gen)
