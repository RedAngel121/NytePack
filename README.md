# NytePack
The new Minecraft Pack that has been in the works for like *forever* and never actually getting done.
We need to talk about Ore Gen... and how that works THEN how it factors in Vein Mining + Farming. 
We need to talk about Currency and Proper Chunk Claiming and how to pay for it. How does this factor into Starting Cash/Mob drops/Loot Chests/UBI + Taxes and other options.

Balance is Key!
