# NytePack
The new Minecraft Pack that has been in the works for like *forever* and never actually getting done.
- Maybe I should describe it here better... but that will come with "effort" into the pack.

WARNING: Single player worlds will break repeatedly as the pack is still under heavy development!
- If you still want to play it then expect your stuff to be reset/borked a lot
- You can get the pack as a full and always up to date release [here](https://github.com/RedAngel121/NytePack/releases/download/NytePack/NytePack_Installer.zip)

~ BUILD TEAM NOTES ~

Pack Build Rules are as follows:
1. No Teleporting items or players (CoRail's Death Key Exception)
2. No Backpacks or On-Person Inventory Storage (mod/item specific things like the Agricraft Pouch are fine)
3. Theme is more Dieselpunk Factory with long-term goals and community play
4. Mod Interconnectivity is desired between Create/IE/other tech mods (Which one do we want producing power?)
5. Update to 1.20.1 if ALL mods are available (after update look into C:TFMG and NuclearCraft)

We need to dive into Vein Mining and by extension... Farming
- Determine how Vein Mining is actually going to affect the player hunger and tool durability

Right now we have EXTREMELY large veins sparsely placed in the world, no other ore gen exists other than Create's world gen stuff

"Ore Factories" will have different ways of processing ore per type:
- Initial layout will be one raw chunk of ore in a furnace makes a nugget
- More complex ore processing will yield better results
- Mekanism (not included) is a good example of this

We need to talk about Currency and Proper Chunk Claiming and how to pay for it through Lightmans Currency (pending big backport update for 1.18.2).
- How does this factor into Starting Cash, Mob Cash Drops, Chest Loot, Login Bonus Income, Taxes, and other options?
- What options do we have for purchasing chunk loading times? cant find anything on this yet...

Balance is Key!

    World:
        SOMETHING that will spruce up The End a bit without breaking YUNG's End Island Overhaul Mod
        Investigate https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unusual-end
        Investigate https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/endless-biomes
        Find a way to increase world build height and lower bedrock

Soft No:

    QOL:
        https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/y-is-there-autojump-forge (if you cant config)
        FancyMenu (Lots of work)
        PackMenu (Lots of work)
        Simple Voice Chat (Possible Server Overhead/Network Issues)

    Mods:
        Beyond Earth (Awating 7.0 update and maybe even avoiding depeding on whats included)
        Create Interactive (propbably not happning due to possible performance/compat issues, will test later)
        Alex's Mobs (some of the mobs are just horrible and need to be disabled)
        Mekanism + Extras (most likely not included because its too streamlined or technically advanced and would need heavy edits to function the way we want)
        Supplementaries (lots of problems with this that im not super intersted in fine tuning yet)
        Comforts (possible compat issues with seasons)
        Lootr (will not be added as it floods the market with items)
        Nightmare Epic Siege ( Disable 90% of the mod?? :Sweats: yea idk yet, some of these things are just not ok but the options for intelegent mobs would be interesting)
        Enhanced Celestials (harvest moon is the only befenit and doesnt provide enough to warrant including the mod)
        Natures Aura (possible server overhead issues because of the chunk aura updates)
        https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/suspicious-zombification ??? (find purpose or reasonable limits)
        https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-dreams-desires (check for Ore Gen and see whats not compatable)
        https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-connected (should be fine but still look at it first)

    World:
        Terralith (slow chunk generation issues)
        Deeper and Darker (not available for 1.18)
        The Undergarden 
            - not something i want personally, but how far outside the realm of the pack is it really?
            - we could turn it into a planet instead of a portal for use with Beyond Earth?

        Swap for Geolosys?: disinclined...

        - Could have integration with lightmans for special purchases (Tickets for Heart Canisters?)

    Config Changes:
        Agricraft - Test if mutated crops hold stats after gowing without crop sticks and replanting and replanting and replanting
        Fix and fine tune the last of the ores and just make everything large bubbles like gold.json... no sense in keeping disks or pylons right now
        SOL Apple Pie - check configs to make sure its going to work like we want, config added and needs adjustment after testing
        Adjust the corail tombstone config as needed
        Apotheosis disable armor drops from every mob, adjust settings
        CC Tweaked - TURN OFF THE TURTLES!
        Farming for Blockheads - just disable the Market, check everything else to make sure it doesnt break the spirit of the pack
        Aircraft needs adjustments (nerf pedal craft) and better integration with crafting recipes (possible steel aircraft industry?)
        Fix Starter Kit to include things players should have day one (What items tho?)
        Check toolbelt config for item white/blacklist (sadly cannot change its size)
        Lightmans needs to update to v2.2 - Change the coin upgrade size to 100/1

Lastly, 
- Agricraft disable "Missing JSON Gen" (L13)
- Remove World Edit Mods and other Admin only mods

- Then start the minecraft dedicated server using the premade server script
