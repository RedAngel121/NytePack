# NytePack
**Welcome to NytePack where innovation is productivity!**
- [Join The GameNytes Discord!](https://discord.gg/kkjwfuz)

# WARNING:
### This pack is not designed to work in a single player enviroment, community server will be designed around this pack
### You are allowed but single player worlds will break repeatedly as the pack is still under heavy development!
- If you still want to play it then expect your stuff to be reset/borked a lot
- No, I'm not helping you if something breaks, I'm probably working that problem anyway
- You can get the pack as a full and always up to date release [here](https://github.com/RedAngel121/NytePack/releases/download/NytePack/NytePack_Installer.zip)
- Requires MultiMC/Prism or AT Launcher to play, ***CurseForge and Microsoft are not compatable.***
- Once a public server is ready I will be making an announcement in the Discord

### Multiplayer Server Rules and things to know:
- Spawn is a Safe Haven; Protected and Defended. Do not find a way to destroy it lest your life be forefit.
- Food and XP grow your health, both are reset on death. Find a way to make better foods and earn more XP to stay alive.
- PVP is enabled but not encouraged, unsecured items can be stolen if left out... so maybe dont do that.
- After a Players death, the items will be locked in the corpse for 7 IRL days, after which corpses become lootable.
- You can Claim Land by purchasing the amount you want, Claims will be deleted after 90 IRL days of inactivity.
- Enemies grow stronger with distance from spawn, do not stray far without preparing yourself for that.
- Different dimensions empower enemies greatly, steel yourself for the fights of your life.
- More info to come when I fell the need to share it...

# ~ PACK BUILD NOTES ~
## Rules are as follows:
1. No Early Game Teleporting items or players (Stargates Exception because power limitations)
2. No Early Game Backpacks or On-Person Inventory Storage (Minor exception to item specific inv spaces)
3. Pack Theme is more Dieselpunk/Factory with long-term goals and community play, Endgame TBD (InterPlanetary/Travel/Stargates/?)
4. Crafting Recipes Inter-Connectivity is desired between most mods for increased complexity pack longevity
5. Power storage/production/transfer will be handled in world, not by held items (to the best of ability)
6. Player travel will be with large scale projects such as Planes/Trains/Stargates/Rockets and not on person items ie jetpacks

# Interesting Ideas:
- [FancyMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fancymenu) OR [PackMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/packmenu): Both are lots of work...
- [Alex's Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-mobs): some of the mobs are just horrible and need to be disabled
- [Aquaculture](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aquaculture): remove neptunium armor/tools and adjust the ingot for netherite application but a different color?
- [Beyond Earth](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/beyond-earth):
  - Progression beyond steel/netherite and I make other planets actually useful
  - Awating 7.0 update and maybe even avoiding depeding on whats included (2025?)
- [Comforts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/comforts)
- [Create: Dreams and Desires](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-dreams-desires): Possibly incompatable with pack direction due to tools
- [Mana and Artifice](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mana-and-artifice): will need mob controls / possible starter book for sale / Ore Generation changes
- [Natures Aura](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natures-aura): possible server overhead issues because of the chunk aura updates
- [Nightmare Epic Siege](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nightmareesm): Disable 90% of the mod: Most things are not ok but more intelligent mobs could be interesting
- [PneumaticCraft: Repressurized](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pneumaticcraft-repressurized) And [Compressed Creativity](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compressedcreativity)
- [Supplementaries](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/supplementaries): lots of problems with this that im not super intersted in fine tuning yet
- [Armourer's Workshop](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/armourers-workshop) Amazing Cosmetic Stuff

# Additional Server World Changes:
- Find out how much Starting Cash will be needed to play on the server
- Disable Portals to other Dims and use a Stargate instead:
  - Stargate will need to be **Pay to Enter** based on destination and have easy access to return from each dimension
  - **Nether** payment will be Iron coins and a diamond
  - **End** payment will be Gold coins and netherite ingot
  - **Abydos** payment will be Emerald coins and chorus bud? dragon egg/head? something else? cataclysm?
  - **Undergarden** payment will be Diamond coins and a stargate base block
- Starting town built by hand or built with minecolonies fortress and more stuff:
  - Will need seperate buildings for different styles of gameplay
  - Server Owned Vending machines as money sinks: Starter Gear, Armors, Weapons, Basic Food, Wallets, and other Simple Items
- Add items to spawn that are common for players to use:
  - Multiple Crafting Tables
  - Anvil and Smith Table
  - Apotheosis Tables
  - Basic Enchanting
  - Vending Machines + ATM
- Baubley Heart Canisters need to be added to purchasable items from server vending machines:
  - Amulet can be purchased for 1 copper / maybe Earned with Easy Gateways?

  - red can = 5 wither bones
  - yellow can = 5 red cans and an iron coin
  - green can = 5 yellow cans and a gold coin
  - blue can = 5 green cans and an emerald coin

# Lastly,
- Adjust Client Keybinds and upload to the Nytepack_Installer.Zip
- Remove World Stripper and other Admin only mods
- Sort out Server vs Client side only mods
- Edit the Server Startup Script to allow packwiz management
- Turn off Wandering Trader `/gamerule doTraderSpawning false` (or find it in server configs?)
- Change Sleep % to 1 (add sleeping bags or something if you want more than 10%)

### Server Update Command Line:
- `java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://redangel121.github.io/NytePack/pack.toml -g -s server`
- For use on servers, add the `-g` flag to disable the GUI and `-s server` to download only server-side mods
- Then start the minecraft dedicated server using the premade server script

- Mekanism: Generators - I need to look into the rest of Mek and see whats worth using
- Mekanism: Tools - I need to look into the rest of Mek and see whats worth using
- Mekanism: Weapons - I need to look into the rest of Mek and see whats worth using
- Refined Storage - Nope, not until I get Mek up to speed
