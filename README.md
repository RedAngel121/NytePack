# NytePack
The new Minecraft Pack that has been in the works for like *forever* and never actually getting done.
- Maybe I should describe it here better... but that will come with "effort" into the pack.

# WARNING:
Single player worlds will break repeatedly as the pack is still under heavy development!
- If you still want to play it then expect your stuff to be reset/borked a lot
- No, I'm not helping you if something breaks, I'm probably working on a problem
- You can get the pack as a full and always up to date release [here](https://github.com/RedAngel121/NytePack/releases/download/NytePack/NytePack_Installer.zip)
- Requires Prism Launcher or AT Launcher to play, ***CurseForge and Microsoft are not compatable.***
- Once a public server is ready we will be making an announcement in the Discord

# ~ BUILD TEAM NOTES ~

## Pack Build Rules are as follows:
1. No Teleporting items or players (CoRail's Death Key Exception)
2. No Backpacks or On-Person Inventory Storage (mod/item specific things like the Agricraft Pouch are fine)
3. Theme is more Dieselpunk Factory with long-term goals and community play
4. Mod Interconnectivity is desired between Create, IE, and other tech mods (Which one do we want producing power?)
5. Update to 1.20.1 if ALL mods are available 
- After update look into 
  - [C:TFMG](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-industry)
  - Mechano (Mod Still Under Heavy Development)
  - [NuclearCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nuclearcraft-neoteric)

We need to dive into Vein Mining, and by extension Farming, to determine how Vein Mining is actually going to affect the player hunger and tool durability. Right now we have EXTREMELY large veins sparsely placed in the world, no other ore gen exists other than Create's world gen stuff, which may be expanded with New Create Mods in 1.20

"Ore Factories" will have different ways of processing ore per type:
- Initial layout will be one raw chunk of ore in a furnace makes a nugget
- More complex ore processing will yield better results
- Mekanism (not included) is a good example of this

We need to talk about Currency and Proper Chunk Claiming and how to pay for it through Lightmans Currency (pending big backport update for 1.18.2).
- How does this factor into Starting Cash, Mob Cash Drops, Chest Loot, Login Bonus Income, Taxes, and other options?
- What options do we have for purchasing chunk loading times? cant find anything on this yet...

- Aquaculture (remove neptunium stuff)

- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-dreams-desires (check for Ore Gen and see whats not compatable)
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-connected (should be fine but still look at it first)

- Investigate https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/endless-biomes
- Find a way to increase world build height and lower bedrock + Flat Bedrock

# Soft No:

### QOL:
- FancyMenu (Lots of work)
- PackMenu (Lots of work)
- Simple Voice Chat (Possible Server Overhead/Network caps)
### Mods:
- Beyond Earth (Awating 7.0 update and maybe even avoiding depeding on whats included)
- Create Interactive (probably not happening due to possible performance/compat issues, will test later)
- Alex's Mobs (some of the mobs are just horrible and need to be disabled)
- Supplementaries (lots of problems with this that im not super intersted in fine tuning yet)
- Comforts (possible compat issues with seasons)
- Nightmare Epic Siege (Disable 90% of the mod: Most things are not ok but intelligent mobs could be interesting)
- Natures Aura (possible server overhead issues because of the chunk aura updates)
### World:
- Terralith (slow chunk generation issues)
- Deeper and Darker (not available for 1.18)
- The Undergarden 
  -  not something i want personally, but how far outside the realm of the pack is it really?
  -  we could turn it into a planet instead of a portal for use with Beyond Earth?

# Hard No:

- Enhanced Celestials (harvest moon is the only befenit and doesnt provide enough to warrant including the mod)
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/suspicious-zombification ??? (find purpose or reasonable limits)
