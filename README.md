# NytePack
**Welcome to NytePack where innovation is productivity!**
- You can get the pack as a full and always up to date release [here](https://github.com/RedAngel121/NytePack/releases/download/NytePack/NytePack_Installer.zip)
- [Join The GameNytes Discord!](https://discord.gg/kkjwfuz)

# WARNING: This pack is not designed to work in a single player enviroment, a community server has been designed around this pack
### Although you are allowed, single player worlds will break repeatedly as the pack is still under development
- If you still want to play it that way then expect your stuff to be reset/borked a lot
- If something breaks, notify me in discord/github so I can start working on that problem
- Requires ATLauncher to play ***as MultiMC, Prism, CurseForge and Microsoft are not currently compatable.*** (subject to change)
- Once a public server is ready I will be making an announcement in [Discord](https://discord.gg/kkjwfuz)

### Multiplayer Server Rules and Things to Know:
- Spawn is a Safe Haven; Protected and Defended. Do not find a way to destroy it lest your life be forefit.
- Food and XP grow your health, both are reset on death. Find a way to make better foods and earn more XP to stay alive.
- PVP is enabled but not encouraged, unsecured items can be stolen if left out... so maybe dont do that.
- After a Players death, the items will be locked in the corpse for 7 IRL days, after which corpses become lootable.
- You can Claim Land by purchasing the amount you want with FLAN, Claims will be deleted after 90 IRL days of inactivity.
- Claims made by MineColonies do not get deleted, but your colony will suffer if not upkept.
- Enemies grow stronger with distance from spawn, do not stray far without preparing yourself for that.
- Different dimensions empower enemies greatly, steel yourself for the fights of your life.

# Interesting Ideas:
- [FancyMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fancymenu) OR [PackMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/packmenu): Both are lots of work...
- [Alex's Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-mobs): some of the mobs are just horrible and need to be disabled
- [Aquaculture](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aquaculture): remove neptunium armor/tools and adjust the ingot for netherite application but a different color?
- [Comforts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/comforts)
- [Create: Dreams and Desires](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-dreams-desires): Possibly incompatable with pack direction due to tools
- [Natures Aura](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natures-aura): possible server overhead issues because of the chunk aura updates
- [Nightmare Epic Siege](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nightmareesm): Disable 90% of the mod: Most things are not ok but more intelligent mobs could be interesting
- [PneumaticCraft: Repressurized](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pneumaticcraft-repressurized) And [Compressed Creativity](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compressedcreativity)
- [Supplementaries](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/supplementaries): lots of problems with this that im not super intersted in fine tuning yet
