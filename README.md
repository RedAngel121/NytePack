# NytePack
**Welcome to NytePack where innovation is productivity!**
- [Join The GameNytes Discord!](https://discord.gg/kkjwfuz)

# WARNING:
Single player worlds will break repeatedly as the pack is still under heavy development!
- If you still want to play it then expect your stuff to be reset/borked a lot
- No, I'm not helping you if something breaks, I'm probably working that problem anyway
- You can get the pack as a full and always up to date release [here](https://github.com/RedAngel121/NytePack/releases/download/NytePack/NytePack_Installer.zip)
- Requires Prism Launcher or AT Launcher to play, ***CurseForge and Microsoft are not compatable.***
- Once a public server is ready I will be making an announcement in the Discord

# ~ BUILD TEAM NOTES ~
## Pack Build Rules are as follows:
1. No Easy Teleporting items or players (Stargates Exception)
2. No Easy Backpacks or On-Person Inventory Storage (Toolbelt and Agricraft Pouch Exceptions or similar item specific inv spaces)
3. Pack Theme is more Dieselpunk/Factory with long-term goals and community play, Endgame TBD (InterPlanetary/Travel/Stargates/?)
4. Crafting Recipes Inter-Connectivity is desired between most mods for increased complexity pack longevity
5. Power storage, production, and transfer, will be handled in world and not by items on the player (to the best of ability)
6. Player travel will be with large scale projects such as Planes/Trains/Stargates/Rockets and not on person items I.E. jetpacks (apoth excluded)

## More Immediate Settings and Changes
1. I need to dive into Vein Mining Enchant configs (and by extension Farming options) to determine how Vein Mining is actually going to affect the player hunger and tool durability.
2. Right now I have large veins sparsely placed in the world, no other ore gen exists other than Create's world gen stuff
3. "Ore Factories" will have different ways of processing ore per type:
  - Initial layout will be one raw chunk of ore in a furnace makes a nugget
  - One raw ore chunk in create mixer makes 1-3 nuggets
  - 1 raw ore in a crushing wheel makes 1-2 crushed ore, then into washer makes 2-4 nuggets each
  - More complex ore processing will yield better results
    - Mekanism (not included) is a good example of this
4. I need to hash out Currency and Proper Chunk Claiming and how to pay for it through/with Lightmans Currency.
  - How does this factor into:
    - Starting Cash? 5i
    - Mob Cash Drops? deep dive
    - Chest Loot? need to add loot tabes from other mods
5. Change the required items in the More Minecarts mod chunk loader to accept coins instead of "crystal" stuff

  - Progression beyond steel/netherite and I make other planets actually useful
  - Awating 7.0 update and maybe even avoiding depeding on whats included (July 2024?)
- [Create Interactive](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-interactive): probably not happening due to possible performance/compat issues, will test later
- [Alex's Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-mobs): some of the mobs are just horrible and need to be disabled/tuned

- [The Undergarden](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-undergarden)

# Hard No:
- Enhanced Celestials (harvest moon is the only befenit and doesnt provide enough to warrant including the mod)
- Lootr (will not be added as it floods the market with items/loot)
- Mekanism (is most likely not included because its too streamlined and technically advanced and would need heavy edits to function the way I want)

# Additional Server World Changes:
- Starting town either built by hand or built with a mod (minecolonies?)
  - Different DIM Portals and shops will be spread around town
  - Will need seperate buildings for different styles of gameplay
  - Server Owned Vending machines as money sinks: Starter Gear, Armors, Weapons, Basic Food, Simple Items, ETC
  - DIM Portals will need to be **Pay to Enter** (lightmans)
- Baubley Heart Canisters need to be added to purchasable items from server vending machines
  - Amulet can be purchased (find good price) maybe Earn with Gateways?
  - bones can be earned with gateways and natural mob spawns
  - red can = 9 wither bones
  - yellow can = 9 red cans and an iron coin
  - green can = 9 yellow cans and a gold coin
  - blue can = 9 green cans and an emerald coin

# Lastly,
- Change Client keybind config and upload to the Nytepack_Installer.Zip
- Remove World Stripper and other Admin only mods
- Sort out Server vs Client side only mods
- Edit the Server Startup Script to allow packwiz management
- Turn off Wandering Trader `/gamerule doTraderSpawning false` (or find it in server configs)
- Change Sleep % to 0 (add sleeping bags if you want more than 50%)

### Server Update Command Line:
- `java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://redangel121.github.io/NytePack/pack.toml -g -s server`
- For use on servers, add the `-g` flag to disable the GUI and `-s server` to download only server-side mods.
- Then start the minecraft dedicated server using the premade server script
